TCA-DIDC 2.4 Overview
============================
The Trajectory Conversion Algorithm - Dynamic Interrogative Data Capture (TCA-DIDC) Version 2.4 Software is designed to test different strategies for producing, transmitting, and storing Connected Vehicle information including the Dynamic Interrogative Data Capture (DIDC) concept and the prototype Basic Mobility Message (BMM). This tool is specifically designed for use in testing the DIDC concept unlike previous software releases. While this release includes the functionality from the TCA Version 2.3, if the user desires to model Probe Data Messages (PDMs), Basic Safety Messages (BSMs), ITS Spot messages, or European Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAM), it is recommended to download and use the TCA Version 2.3. The TCA-DIDC reads in and uses vehicle trajectory information, Roadside Equipment (RSE) location information, cellular region information, event region information, and strategy information to produce a series of snapshots that the vehicle would produce. Vehicles can be equipped to generate and transmit the prototype BMM, Probe Data Message (PDM), Basic Safety Message (BSM), ITS SPOT message, and/or European Union’s Cooperative Awareness Message (CAM) which can be transmitted by either Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC), cellular, or both.

System Requirements
-------------------------
The TCA-DIDC 2.4 software can run on most standard Window or Linux based computers with 
Pentium core processers, with at least two gigabits of RAM and at least 100 MB of drive space.
Performance of the software will be based on the computing power and available RAM in 
the system.  Larger datasets can require much larger space requirements depending on the 
amount of data being read into the software.

The TCA-DIDC 2.4 software application was developed using the open source
programming language Python 2.7 (www.python.org).  The application requires Python 2.7
or higher to run.  Note that Python 3.0 is a change from Python 2.X language and will not
run the DMA performance measurement application.  Python versions 2.7.X – 2.9.X will work.

The application can be run on Windows, Linux, or Mac operating systems.  Python is installed
by default on many Linux and Mac operating systems.


Documentation
-------------

The TCA-DIDC 2.4 software is packaged with Word based User Guide
"The Trajectory Convertor Algorithm DIDC 2 4 User manual.doc" that contains all information about background
purpose, benefits, objectives, inputs/outputs, how to run the software and requirements for the software.
Also included are the "DIDC Concept of Operations_FINAL_REPORT.docx" and the 
"Trajectory Conversion Algorithm DIDC.docx" which describe the DIDC concept.
