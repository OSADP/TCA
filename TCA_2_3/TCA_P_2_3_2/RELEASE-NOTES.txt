Initial release version 2.0 
-------------------------------------
Basic updating of the orginal TCA-P software from 2005.  This version is not avaliable for download


Initial release version 2.1
-------------------------------------
Vehicles can be equipped to generate and transmit Probe Data Messages (PDMs) or Basic Safety Messages (BSMs) which can be transmitted by either Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) or via cellular. Version 2 Build 1 or 2.1 assumes perfect communication between vehicles and RSEs but future versions will include simulated communication disruptions. As soon as a vehicle equipped to transmit via DSRC is in range of a RSE, it will download all of its snapshot information directly without any loss of information. Similarly, if the vehicle is equipped to transmit via cellular, it will download all its snapshot information directly but those snapshots might be lost or delayed due to user-defined loss rate and latency.


Initial release version 2.2
-------------------------------------
Vehicles can now be equipped to generate and transmit both PDMs and BSMs as well as transmit via both DSRC and Cellular. Version 2 Build 2 or 2.2 assumes perfect communication between vehicles and RSEs but future versions will include simulated communication disruptions. As soon as a vehicle equipped to transmit via DSRC is in range of a RSE, it will download all of its snapshot information directly without any loss of information. Similarly, if the vehicle is equipped to transmit via cellular, it will download all its snapshot information directly but those snapshots might be lost or delayed due to user-defined loss rate and latency. The user can also include event regions to simulate events such as wipers, traction control, etc. each with a defined probabiliy and recheck value.


Initial release version 2.3
-------------------------------------
Support for international message types, the European Cooperative Awareness Message (CAM) and the Japanese ITS Spot message, has been added. CAM and ITS Spot both transmit via Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) and produce message outputs consistent with publicly defined standards. Unlike previous versions, version 2.3 does not assume perfect communication between vehicles and roadside equipment and instead emulates the probabilistic uncertainties of DSRC. Version 2.3 also allows Probe Data Messages and Basic Safety Messages to be transmitted at user defined intervals. 

Release version 2.3.1
-------------------------------------
Added additional J2735 elements to the BSM output including DSRC Message ID and a temporary ID that changes every 5 minutes. Fixed a bug with the PDM Stop Snapshots. Improved the runtime and code efficiency. 

Release version 2.3.2
-------------------------------------
Added acceleration to PDM output. Re-organized code by moving BSM, PDM, SPOT, and CAM code into seperate python files.
